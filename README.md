Exercise 2.11 for the Barto and Sutton book. Started from my [exercise 2.5 repo](https://github.com/Joel-Singh/exercise-2-5)

If you want to run it yourself simply just run "python main.py"

No graph here, because it takes an egrigous amount of time to run at 2000 runs and 200,000 steps. Could be because of my old x260 thinkpad or bad code, not sure. But I don't want to spend more time than I already have on trying to optimize it, especially with how long it took me to just write it. Just going to continue on with the book.
